    "description": "Ground Zero is the ultimate zombie apocalypse experience and focuses on an alternate vision of the Commonwealth that has instead been overtaken by the ramifications of a deadly viral outbreak. As a military operative it will be your mission to enter the Commonwealth and eradicate any trace of the virus and its infected victims. There are also features around base-building and survivor rescue/recruitment if you are interested in the rebuilding society angle of things. Most vanilla quests/NPC\u0027s and much of the base game content has been replaced with more appropriate dynamic systems for a zombie apocalypse playthrough with other missions/quests/objectives to lead you along your way.",
