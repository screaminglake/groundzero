# 1.2.5

## Major Updates

  -Introduction of "Generic Whispers", a plugin created in-house by our very own Sweet6Shooter for Whispering Chills now adapted to rework core elements of Ground Zero.  Major changes include the removal of rad-removal/prevention items, stealth boys, syringers, combined meds, and bobbleheads both placed and in levelled lists; and renaming of NPC's, armor, ingestibles, and other items to reflect the real world instead of being bound to the Fallout universe hopefully increasing the immersive realism of a real zombie apocalypse <br />
  
  -Addition of Commonwealth Supply Caches which places 18 "supply drops" around the Commonwealth left behind by the military for you to find.  The starting chest behind the player home has had most of its items redistributed to these chests with a 25% chance of any of the mod-added armors or weapons spawning in them.  Head to the Recon Bunker on the side of Wicked Shipping Fleet Lockup and obtain the key and list of locations to find these <br />
  
  -Full item sorting/tagging using FallUI Icon Library/Sorter plus Complex Sorter which now includes full ECO workbench integration <br />
  
  -Adjustments to respawn timers to hopefully prevent cells from respawning so you can consider an area "cleared out" (with the exception of roaming, dynamic hordes and infestations) <br />
  
  -Total perk rework with a major update and rebranding of Creative Perks Plus to True Perks <br />
  
  -Audio overhaul update with the addition of Lush Ambience and a major update to LOST Audio Tweaks and its patches to provide an overall more immersive and consistent soundscape both indoors and outdoors <br />
  
  -Addition of Vivid Weathers MCM Settings Menu thanks as always to M8r for making these.  Now you can easily adjust lighting values and the current weather via its MCM menu <br />

# 1.2

  -Most of the setup workflow for Ground Zero has now been automated via the new MCM settings preset so be sure to read the Holotape and MCM Configuration section of the documentation or watch the new Introduction to Ground Zero video for 1.2 to see the new expedited setup workflow.  Big thanks to M8r98a4f2 for their amazing work with converting cumbersome holotapes into MCM settings menu's which can be stored and easily applied by any user using MCM settings manager! <br />
  
  -Added Feral Infestations (new infestations will appear dynamically across the Commonwealth with a new miscellaneous objective to clear them out.  More will form over time and the size of the infestation will "level up" every 24 hours that it goes uncontained until it maxes out and proceeds to attack the closest settlement) <br />
  
  -Added Settlement Attack Spawns Outside the Settlement and SKK Move Workshop Markers to help users mitigate settlement attacks popping up within closed off settlements (sadly this cannot be entirely avoided due to F4 engine issues with AI pathing.  Recommended to sleep indoors or within a constructible workshop bunker which counts as an interior at night) <br />
